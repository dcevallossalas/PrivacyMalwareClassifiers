This project includes the construction of classifiers using different machine learning algorithms.

The dataset used for this task is CIC-MalMem-2022, which has 55 features for malware classification.

The project first performs the t-SNE visualization of the data.

Secondly, it implements the binary classifier that allows to classify the observations between benign and malicious.

Subsequently, a 4-classes classifier is made that allows distinguishing between benign observations and malicious 
observations of the spyware, ransomware and trojan horse categories.

A SMOTE oversampling technique then is applied in order to compare the results among using this technique and not.

Finally, a 16-classes classifier is built in order to classify the observations between benign and 15 classes of malware.

In the same way, the SMOTE technique has been used to make a comparison of results.
